# docker case study


You work as a Devops Engineer in a leading Software Company. You have been asked to
Dockerize the applications on the production server. The company uses custom software,
therefore there is no pre-built container which can be used.
Assume the following things:
1. Assume the software to be installed is apache
2. Use an Ubuntu container
The company wants the following things:
1. Push a container to DockerHub with the above config
2. The Developers will not be working with Docker, hence from their side you will just get the
code. Write a Dockerfile which could put the code in the custom image that you have built
